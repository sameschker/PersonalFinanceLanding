# Privacy Policy

## 1. Overview

This project is a personal, single-user application operated solely by the project owner. The application accesses and processes **only the project owner’s own financial account data** for personal use.

No data is collected from the general public, external users, or third parties other than Plaid.

---

## 2. Information Collected

The application may access the following information via Plaid, limited strictly to the project owner’s accounts:

* Financial account metadata (e.g., institution name, account type)
* Account balances
* Transaction data, where enabled

No data is collected about any other individuals.

---

## 3. How Information Is Used

Collected data is used solely for:

* Personal financial analysis or display
* Application functionality related to Plaid integration
* Testing and development purposes

The data is **not sold, shared, or used for advertising**.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

* All data is stored locally on the project owner’s personal laptop
* Data is encrypted at rest using operating system and/or application-level encryption
* Data transmitted between the application and Plaid is encrypted in transit using TLS
* Access to the data is restricted exclusively to the project owner

---

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

* Data is retained only for as long as needed for personal use
* The project owner may delete stored data at any time
* Upon deletion, data is removed from local encrypted storage

No centralized servers or shared databases are used to store this data.

---

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

The application uses Plaid to connect to financial institutions. Plaid’s use of data is governed by Plaid’s own Privacy Policy.

Other than Plaid, no third parties receive access to the data.

---

## 7. User Rights

Because the application processes only the project owner’s own data:

* The project owner has full access to, and control over, all stored data
* Data may be accessed, modified, or deleted directly through the application or local system

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the project or its data practices. Updates will be posted in this repository.
